## 🚀 Deployment & Tooling Improvements (December 2025)

### Package Management Migration to `uv`
- **Consolidated all dependencies** into `pyproject.toml` (removed `requirements.txt`, `requirements-codequality.txt`, `requirements-docs.txt`)
- Migrated from pip to **uv** for faster, reproducible builds
- Added `.python-version` file pinning Python 3.11
- Generated `uv.lock` with 221 packages for deterministic installs
- Removed unused `azure-ai-ml` dependency (saved ~500MB, 12 packages)

### Devcontainer Improvements
- Rewrote `.devcontainer/` for **ARM64/x86 multi-architecture support**
- Uses uv installer with `--extra dev --extra docs`
- Multi-arch Bicep CLI download via GitHub releases API
- Streamlined `post_create.sh` for faster container startup

### Terraform Deployment Fixes
- **Fixed deprecated property**: `enable_rbac_authorization` → `rbac_authorization_enabled` in Key Vault
- **Fixed count dependency issue**: Added `enable_voice_live` boolean variable to appconfig module for plan-time count evaluation
- **Fixed outputs.tf**: Added `length()` checks for conditional module references
- Preprovision script now writes `main.tfvars.json` dynamically with `environment_name`, `location`, `deployed_by`

### azd Remote State Setup
- Simplified interactive prompts: `[Y]es / [n]o / [c]ustom` for remote state configuration
- Auto-generates storage account, container, and resource group names
- Custom option allows overriding individual values
- Clear warnings for local state usage in non-production

### Documentation Updates
- Completely rewrote `docs/guides/repository-structure.md` to reflect actual codebase
- Updated notebooks and docs with uv commands
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow for uv
