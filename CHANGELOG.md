## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- VoiceLive announces the initial active agent once and emits a single notification per
  agent transition, rather than repeating "Active agent" on every turn.
- Context-only VoiceLive acknowledgements no longer interrupt playback or cancel responses.
  Identical instruction updates are skipped, while changed conversation context and full
  agent/scenario configuration updates are preserved.

### 🔌 MCP Protocol & Lifecycle Management

This release updates the MCP integration to spec 2025-11-25, introduces deferred startup for non-blocking health checks, and enhances lifecycle observability.

### Added

- **Deferred Startup Pattern** — MCP validation runs asynchronously after `/health` returns 200, preventing deployment probe failures
- **Health Endpoints** — New `/api/v1/ready`, `/api/v1/readiness`, and `/api/v1/pools` endpoints for granular startup observability
- **Lifecycle Dashboard** — Background task status with pending/in-progress/completed/failed states

- **Lifecycle Documentation** — New `docs/architecture/lifecycle.md` covering startup phases and health probes

### Enhanced

- **MCP Protocol** — Updated to spec 2025-11-25 with `streamable-http` as default transport (replaces `sse`)
- **FastMCP Integration** — CardAPI MCP server refactored with `@mcp.custom_route()` for health endpoints
- **Backend Indicator** — Frontend now shows deferred startup status and pending task count
- **Agent Builder** — Added Responses API toggle functionality
- **Postprovision Scripts** — Enhanced CardAPI data provisioning with improved error handling

### Fixed

- **Terraform Git Commit** — Fixed `data.external.git_commit` to output valid JSON
- **MCP Client** — Improved error handling for `streamable-http` transport connections
- **Cosmos Init** — Enhanced database initialization with better retry logic

### Infrastructure

- **Deployment Workflow** — Added CardAPI MCP test step to CI/CD template
- **VS Code Launch Config** — Updated debug configurations for MCP servers

### Documentation

- **MCP Integration Guide** — Added transport types table, deferred startup section, settings reference
